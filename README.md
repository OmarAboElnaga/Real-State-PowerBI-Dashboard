- **Focus on Low-Performing Cities:** Investigate Dodowa for local challenges, and develop targeted marketing or property upgrades.
- **Salesperson Training:** Encourage underperformers like Tulika and Charles through coaching and performance incentives.
- **Capitalize on Q4 Trend:** Consider running promotions or scaling operations in the final months of the year to leverage higher demand.
