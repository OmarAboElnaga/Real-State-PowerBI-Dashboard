- **Focus on Low-Performing Cities:** Investigate Dodowa for local challenges, and develop targeted marketing or property upgrades.
- **Salesperson Training:** Encourage underperformers like Tulika and Charles through coaching and performance incentives.
- **Optimize Costs:** Since the cost to revenue ratio associated with 3-Bedroom properties are significantly higher than those of other property types, it's important to identify opportunities to streamline operations and improve cost-efficiency.
